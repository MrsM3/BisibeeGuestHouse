    <h1>Sightseeing & Day Trips</h1>
<p>Oudtshoorn offers a large variety of sightseeing trips – some are local such as the ostrich farms and the famous Cango Caves. If you plan your trip in this area in conjunction with Bisibee, we will be more than happy to advise you.</p>
<p></p>

    <h2>Cango Caves</h2>
    <p>The Cango Caves lie approximately 30 km to the north of Bisibee. On the way to the caves one can stop at the Rus en Vrede Waterfall. This is a very pretty walk into the heart of a gorge with a worthwhile stop at the end.</p>


    <h2>Cango Wildlife Ranch</h2>
<p>Cango Wildlife Ranch is a good family outing, Buffelsdrift Game Lodge is a splendid place to spend the late afternoon, sipping a beer and watching the animals.</p>



    <h2>Ostrich Farms</h2>
<p>Visiting an Ostrich Farm is very interesting. Due to the heat in summer, it is our recommendation that you do this early in the morning i.e. just after breakfast.</p>


<h2>Swartberg Pass</h2>
<p>The Swartberg pass can basically be divided into two sections – The Gamkaskloof (Hell) and a roundtrip (Excluding the Gamkaskloof) which includes Prince Albert, Meiringspoort and De Rust. Both trips start in Oudtshoorn. Just beyond the Cango Caves, the actual pass begins and as you climb, one is treated with a lovely view of the Oudtshoorn side of the Swartberg. Once you reach the centre of the pass, the road splits and one can either go to the Gamkaskloof or continue on to Prince Albert.
Swartberg Pass Via Meiringspoort. This is a day trip covering an approximate distance of 190 kilometres. A relatively early start is advised and it is possible to include the Cango Caves. The initial climb up the Oudtshoorn side of the pass is very pretty and there are plenty of stops to take some photographs or have refreshments. The road continues over the top of the mountains spilling out into the Great Karoo and lunch can be had in the quaint village of Prince Albert. After lunch the road continues to Meiringspoort and once again there is a feast of nice things to see. At one of the stops it is possible to have a walk to a lovely little waterfall. This walk is suitable for elderly people. From Meiringspoort, the road continues through De Rust. This is a nice place to stop for a cup of tea or coffee. If time allows, there is a detour that will take one all along the foothills of the Swartberg back to Oudtshoorn.</p>
